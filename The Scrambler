Proposal: 

  A word game made by four people (two from F block, two from E block). It would consist of a 5x5 2D array of different letters. Similar to the Game 
  Pigeon game Word Hunt, the user has to find words based on letters that are close to each other. However, every time a word is entered, the board will 
  scramble with new letters. Longer words are worth more points, and the high score after a series of boards will be recorded. Future players will aim to 
  beat the high score. There might be slight changes in this design later that will make the game/code harder.
