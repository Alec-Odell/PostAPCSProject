Stage 1: Proposal

A proposal for a project requires at least three students, with at least one student from each block! (This will require you to utilize GitHub and learn about branches, commits, and pulls.) The proposal must address each of the following:

 General description of the goal or purpose. What are you trying to make happen or solve? Feel free to design projects which utilize content from other courses (simulations, for example), address and analyze real daata and problems (the environment, anyone?), or have other useful impacts.

 Using a 2d array which is 8x8 we would simulate a chess board with peices. moves will then be inputted by the user, and the board will be updated acordingly. 

 Anticipated file structure (i.e. what classes will you write, where will the main method exist? Show me that you have thought enough about this problem or project to begin to recognize some of the complexity you will need to account for.
 
 their will be a main method that will run the game, and their will also be some sort of peice class that would outline possible moves and identifying factors.
 
 New Java - your proposal/project must require you to utilize some new code structures. This could include learning how to read/write files into a JAVA program, rudimentary graphics, or some utilize some other class for your project.

 depending on how hard it would be to code the chess board and class an html file or graphics file could be produced to display the chess board.

Division of labor: who will do what in this project? Is there enough required to justify the time and number of people? This will be the sole task which you will be engaged in during class time, but there is minimal expectation for work outside of class (unless you are not meeting your goals).
